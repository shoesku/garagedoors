Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to fix the problem without having to call in a professional. This article will provide an overview of the most common causes of an opening garage door and the solutions you can try, so that you can get back to using your garage again in no time.</p><h2>Check the Sensors</h2><p>The first step to take when your overhead garage door keeps opening is to check the sensors. Many modern garage openers are equipped with infrared sensors that detect when something is in the way of the door's path. If the sensors are dirty, misaligned, or obstructed, the door may not be able to close all the way. To fix the issue, start by cleaning the sensors with a soft cloth. Then check that they are pointing straight at each other and not obstructed by anything. Lastly, make sure the batteries are still working.</p><h2>Check the Track Alignment</h2><p>If the sensors appear to be working correctly, then the next step is to inspect the track alignment. Overhead garage doors operate on tracks that are mounted to the wall. If the tracks are bent, misaligned, or not properly secured, the door may not be able to close all the way. To fix the issue, start by inspecting the tracks for any signs of damage. If necessary, you may need to use a hammer to gently straighten the tracks. Also, make sure that the tracks are securely fastened to the wall.</p><h2>Check the Springs</h2><p>If the track alignment appears to be correct, the next step is to check the springs. Garage door springs provide the tension that helps the door open and close. If the springs are too weak or too strong, the door may not be able to remain closed. To fix this issue, start by inspecting the springs for any signs of damage. If they are broken or worn out, you may need to replace them. You can also adjust the tension on the springs to make sure they are providing the right amount of tension.</p><h2>Check the Limit Settings</h2><p>If the springs appear to be functioning correctly, then the next step is to check the limit settings. Many modern garage door openers come with adjustable limit settings that allow you to set the upper and lower limits for how far the door should open and close. If the limits are set too close, the door may not be able to close all the way. To fix this issue, start by adjusting the limit settings to make sure they are not set too close.</p><h2>Check the Chain</h2><p>If the limit settings appear to be correct, then the next step is to inspect the chain. Many overhead garage door openers rely on a chain to lift and lower the door. If the chain is loose or there is too much slack, the door may not be able to close all the way. To fix this issue, start by inspecting the chain for any signs of damage. If necessary, you may need to replace the chain. Also, make sure there is enough tension on the chain so that it can lift and lower the door without any problems.</p><h2>Check the Tension Cable</h2><p>If the chain appears to be working correctly, then the next step is to check the tension cable. Many overhead garage door openers rely on a tension cable to help keep the door in place when it is opened and closed. If the tension cable is loose or broken, the door may not be able to stay closed. To fix this issue, start by inspecting the tension cable for any signs of damage. If necessary, you may need to replace the cable. Also, make sure there is enough tension on the cable so that it can keep the door in place.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>An overhead garage door that keeps opening can be an annoying and potentially dangerous problem. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to fix the issue without having to call in a professional. Start by checking the sensors, track alignment, springs, limit settings, chain, and tension cable for any signs of damage. If any of these components appear to be damaged or misaligned, you may need to replace or adjust them. With a few simple steps, you can get your overhead garage door back to working properly.</p></code> Create a news, tips, review, or tutorial blog article in this year 2023 about "best practices for SEO" in relaxed english language.
